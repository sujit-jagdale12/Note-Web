			<i>Note-taking (sometimes written as note-taking or note taking)
				is the practice of recording information from different sources and
				platforms. By taking notes, the writer records the essence of the
				information,freeing their mind from having to recall everything
				Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source, such as an oral
				discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are
				usually called minutes), in which case the notes may be the only
				record of the event. Since the advent of writing and literacy, notes
				traditionally were almost always handwritten (often in notebooks),
				but the advent of notetaking software has made digital notetaking
				possible and widespread. Note-taking is a foundational skill in
				personal knowledge management.</i>
